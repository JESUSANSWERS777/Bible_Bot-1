# Bible_Bot
This code documents my ongoing project to create a Reddit bot that provides information to Reddit users about specific verses in the
Torah or Bible when these verses are mentioned in comments.
Please note that the code shown here does not contain the praw initiation since that would require me to give up my Reddit username
and password as well as my secret key for the bot. There are ample resources online for you to read if you wish to create your own bot,
but because of these omissions simply copying and pasting this code will not create a functional bot.
Please see LICENSE.txt for licensing information.
